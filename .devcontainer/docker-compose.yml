    # 1. Bind mount the workspace to /workspace in the container. This must match the "workspaceFolder" in devcontainer.json.
    # 2. Create named volumes for node_modules and pnpm store so that they persist between container restarts and are not shared with the host. This improves performance, especially on Windows and macOS.
    # 3. Create a named volume for pnpm-home to persist pnpm global installs and cache.
